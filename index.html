            <h2>Data Collection and Usage</h2>
            <p>The Extension only collects and processes the following types of user data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Web History</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Data Collected:</strong> The URLs of YouTube video pages visited by the user.</li>
                        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To identify if a user is on a YouTube video page and enable bookmarking functionality for specific timestamps.</li>
                        <li><strong>How It Works:</strong> The Extension checks the URL of the active browser tab to determine if it matches the pattern youtube.com/watch. If it does, the Extension extracts the video ID from the URL to store bookmarks uniquely for that video.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Website Content</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Data Collected:</strong> DOM elements of YouTube video pages (e.g., player controls) are accessed to add bookmarking buttons and manage user interactions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To allow users to save, view, and delete bookmarks directly on YouTube pages.</li>
                        <li><strong>How It Works:</strong> The Extension injects content scripts into YouTube pages to manipulate the DOM and add interactive features like bookmark buttons.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Data Storage</h2>
            <p>All data collected by the Extension is stored locally in the user's browser using Chrome's storage API. This includes:</p>
